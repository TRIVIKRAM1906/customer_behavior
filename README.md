Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis
1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900
purchases across various product categories. The main objective is to uncover insights into
spending patterns, customer segments, product preferences, and subscription behavior to guide
strategic business decisions.
2. Dataset Summary
The dataset contains 3,900 rows and 18 columns, including demographic, transactional, and
behavioral attributes. Key features include age, gender, location, subscription status, purchase
amount, item category, discount usage, review rating, and shipping type. There were 37 missing
values in the review rating column, which were handled appropriately.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
1 Loaded and explored the dataset using pandas and numpy.
2 Handled missing data by imputing median ratings within each product category.
3 Renamed columns to a consistent snake_case format for clarity.
4 Created new features such as age groups and purchase frequency intervals.
5 Dropped redundant variables after a consistency check between discount and promo code
fields.
6 Integrated the cleaned dataset with PostgreSQL for further SQL-based analysis.
4. Data Analysis using SQL
1 Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.
2 Identified high-spending customers who used discounts yet spent above the average purchase
amount.
3 Determined the top five products by average review rating.
4 Compared average purchase values between standard and express shipping types.
5 Assessed the difference in spending and revenue between subscribers and non-subscribers.
6 Highlighted products most frequently purchased with discounts.
7 Segmented customers into New, Returning, and Loyal groups based on purchase frequency.
8 Listed the top three purchased products within each product category.
9 Examined if customers with more than five purchases were more likely to have subscriptions.
10 Calculated total revenue contributions from each age group.
5. Dashboard in Power BI
An interactive Power BI dashboard was designed to visualize insights from SQL and Python
analysis. It includes charts, KPIs, and slicers for exploring key metrics such as sales by gender,
category, and subscription status, as well as the impact of shipping types and discounts. The
dashboard enables decision-makers to derive actionable insights efficiently.
6. Business Recommendations
1 Promote subscription benefits to attract more recurring customers.
2 Introduce customer loyalty programs to enhance retention and engagement.
3 Reassess discount policies to maintain profitability without sacrificing demand.
4 Feature top-rated and best-selling products in marketing campaigns.
5 Target express-shipping and high-value demographics through personalized promotions.
7. Tools and Technologies Used
1 Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data preparation and visualization.
2 PostgreSQL for SQL-based analysis and querying.
3 Power BI for creating the interactive business dashboard.
4 Gamma App / PowerPoint for presenting key findings and recommendations.
8. Conclusion
This project provided deep insights into customer purchase behavior and highlighted patterns that
can drive strategic business improvements. Findings regarding discounts, loyalty, and
demographics offer clear direction for marketing and customer retention strategies. The project
demonstrates practical experience in Python analytics, SQL querying, and Power BI dashboard
development for business intelligence applications.
